Sample User Credentials for Development

Employee Dashboard Login:
- Email: employee1@example.com
- Password: password123
- Role: Employee (is_manager = False)

Manager/Client Dashboard Login:
- Email: manager1@example.com
- Password: password123
- Role: Manager (is_manager = True)

Website Administrator Dashboard Login:
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: adminpass
- Role: Website Administrator (Django superuser)

Note:
- These credentials are for development and testing purposes only.
- To use these credentials, the corresponding user accounts must be created in the database.
- The "is_manager" flag distinguishes between employee and manager roles.
- Website administrators are typically Django superusers with full permissions.

If you need, I can also provide instructions or commands to create these users in the database.
